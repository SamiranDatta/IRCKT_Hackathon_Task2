# IRCKT_Hackathon_Task2

To make separate ROS nodes in order to make different geometric shapes with the given robot.

The robot provided had to trace out a square, a triangle, a 5-point star and a circle as can be seen from the video attached.

The real challenges faced were low real-time factor and low fps as I was using VirtualBox. But eventually, after a few tweaks , I somehow managed to minimize the error.

This is my submission for Task 2.
